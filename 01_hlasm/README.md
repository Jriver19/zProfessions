# z/Professions HLASM excercises

The following files are the excercises from the z/Professions course and are copyright IBM.

To use these exampls copy them to a MVS dataset (usually `USER.STAGE2.ASMn.SOURE` and `USER.STAGE2.ASMn.JCL`, where `n` is relates to the day on which the course was given (then JCL will probably include the name of the dataset of the source file, so look at those first). Submit the JCL and check the output in SDSF (ISPF option `S.ST`) for the output of the Assembler.
